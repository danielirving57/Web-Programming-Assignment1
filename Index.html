<h2>Personal Traits, Hobbies, and Their Impact on My Education</h2>
<p>My top three strongest personality traits are determination, hard work, and empathy, and they have a strong effect on my academic life and personal growth. My determination helps me stay focused on my goals and not give up when schoolwork becomes difficult. When I face challenges, I continue trying until I understand the work and improve.
 My hardworking nature means I put steady effort into my studies by completing assignments on time, reviewing my work, and always trying to do my best. My empathy allows me to understand and support others, which helps me work well with classmates and build positive relationships in group tasks and projects. Along with these traits, my hobbies such as playing bass guitar, gaming, and practicing Capture the Flag challenges help keep me balanced and motivated. 
 Playing bass guitar helps me relax and express myself, while gaming and challenge-based activities improve my focus and problem-solving skills. These hobbies support my learning by keeping me engaged and mentally active. Together, my traits and hobbies help me stay disciplined, motivated, and connected to others, which improves my performance at school and prepares me to contribute positively to society.<p></div>

	The show blends action, detective work, and personal drama as Oliver builds a team, confronts powerful enemies, and struggles to balance his double life as both
	a public figure and a masked hero.</p>

<h2>My Hero and Why They Inspire Me</H2>
<p>My hero is Oliver Queen from the TV series Arrow, 
and my favourite quote from him is, “To live, I had to make myself more than what I was, to forge myself into a weapon.” This quote is inspiring because it shows that real change does not happen by accident. Oliver Queen was once careless and selfish, but after facing extreme hardship, he chose to rebuild himself through discipline, training, and self-control. 
What inspires me most is that he does not become strong just for himself. He becomes strong so he can protect others and correct the mistakes of his past. His journey teaches that pain and struggle can be used as tools for growth instead of excuses to quit. It reminds me that success requires effort, patience, and personal sacrifice.
 The quote motivates me to improve myself every day by working harder, learning more, and becoming more responsible. It shows that true strength is not only physical, but also mental and moral, and that becoming better is a choice you must make even when it is difficult.</p></div>

<h2>Report on a Favourite AI Business Idea from “AI Businesses of 2025”</H2>
<p>
My favourite idea from the list is AI for fraud detection and prevention in banking because it directly protects people’s money and builds trust in financial systems. In today’s world, many people rely on online banking, card payments, and mobile apps to manage their finances.
 This makes banks a major target for criminals who use scams, fake websites, and stolen card details to steal money.
 AI can be applied in my world by being built into banking systems to watch transactions as they happen. 
 For example, if someone usually spends small amounts in their local area and suddenly a large payment is made in another country, the system can notice this unusual behaviour and block the transaction or alert the bank and customer. 
 This is useful because it can stop fraud before the money is lost, reduce stress for customers, and save banks large sums of money that would otherwise be lost to crime.<br></p>

<p>AI-based fraud detection is more effective than older rule-based systems because it can learn over time. As scammers change their methods, the AI system can study new patterns and improve how it identifies risky activity. This makes banking safer and helps banks respond faster to threats. It also supports customer confidence, since people feel more secure knowing that their bank is actively monitoring for fraud in the background.<br></p>

<p>However, there are important ethical issues related to this idea. 
One major concern is privacy, because the AI must look at transaction data to work properly. Customers may worry about how their information is used and stored.
 Another issue is fairness, since an AI system might wrongly flag certain people as suspicious based on incomplete or biased data. There is also the risk of over-reliance on automation, where human judgment is reduced and mistakes go unnoticed.</p>

<p>To address these moral concerns, banks should ensure that AI systems are transparent and only use customer data for fraud prevention purposes. 
Strong data protection laws and secure storage systems should be in place to protect personal information. AI decisions should also be reviewed by human staff, especially when an account is blocked or a transaction is declined. 
This keeps the system fair and prevents customers from being treated unjustly. Regular testing of the AI system can also help reduce bias and improve accuracy.</p> 

<p>In conclusion, AI for fraud detection and prevention is a powerful and useful idea because it protects money, improves trust in banks, and adapts to new types of crime. When used responsibly with strong ethical rules, it can make financial systems safer for everyone.</p>
