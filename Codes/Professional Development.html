		<h1> Chapter 4</h1>
		<p>Achieve Your Goals
Charlie teaches Michael that goal-setting is one of the most
powerful habits a person can develop, not just because of 
what you gain at the finish line, but because of who you 
become while working toward it. He breaks goals down into
 three categories which are long-range, mid-range, and short-range,
 and emphasizes that writing them down is what transforms a wish into
 a real, pursuable target. The act of putting your goals on paper activates 
 your mind and gives you a sense of direction that most people never experience.
 One of the most memorable lessons from this chapter is that you cannot
 change your destination overnight, but you can change your direction overnight.
 No matter where you are right now, no matter how much time you feel you've wasted
 or how far behind you think you are, a single decision to shift your direction 
 today can set everything in motion. The key is not to wait until you feel ready
 but to start moving and let the momentum build from there.</p>

		<h1> Chapter 5</h1>
			<p>The Proper Use of Time
Charlie delivers one of the most sobering truths in this chapter, which is that every person will experience one of two pains in life. The first is the pain of discipline and the second is the pain of regret. While discipline may feel uncomfortable in the moment, regret
 is a far heavier burden to carry for a lifetime. He points out that most people
 spend their days trapped in the urgent, constantly reacting to whatever demands
 their attention, while neglecting the important tasks that would actually move 
 their lives forward. Time is the one resource you can never get back, and how
 you choose to spend it each day is quietly shaping the kind of future you will
 live. Charlie also warns that if you don't take control of your own schedule 
 and design your life with intention, you will naturally fall into someone else's
 plan and that plan rarely has much room for your dreams or growth. Learning to 
 say no to distractions and yes to the things that align with your goals is one 
 of the most difficult but necessary disciplines you can build.<p>

		<h1> Chapter 6</h1>
			<p>Surround Yourself With the Best People
In this chapter, Charlie challenges Michael to pause and take an honest
 look at the people he spends the most time with, because those relationships
 are silently shaping his beliefs, his habits, his attitude, and ultimately
 his future. The people closest to you have an enormous influence on how you 
 see yourself and what you believe is possible, often without you even realizing
 it. Charlie encourages Michael to ask himself a powerful question, which is who 
 am I becoming because of the people around me, and is that okay? This isn't 
 about being harsh or cutting people off without care but about being intentional
 and honest about what certain relationships are costing you in terms of your 
 growth and potential. Successful people are deliberate about building a circle 
 of individuals who inspire them, challenge them, and model the values and 
 character they want to develop. When you surround yourself with people who
 are growing, ambitious, and positive, that energy becomes contagious and lifts
 you higher than you could go alone.</p>

		<h1> Chapter 7</h1>
		<p>Achieve Your Goals
Be a Life-Long Learner
Charlie introduces a distinction in this chapter that carries enormous weight,
 which is that formal education can help you make a living, but self-education 
 is what can truly make you a fortune. School gives you a foundation, but the
 learning that happens after through books, mentors, meaningful conversations
 , personal study, and real-world experience is what separates people who grow 
 from people who stagnate. Charlie emphasizes that the most successful people in 
 the world are not those who stopped learning when they received a diploma, 
 but those who treated every day as an opportunity to become more knowledgeable, 
 more skilled, and more self-aware. Growth is not something that happens to you 
 passively but requires a conscious decision to stay curious, stay humble, and 
 keep investing in yourself even when no one is requiring you to. When you take
 full responsibility for your own development, you stop waiting for a teacher,
 a class, or the right opportunity to come along, and you become the kind of
 person who creates their own opportunities through the depth of what they 
 know and who they are becoming.</p>
